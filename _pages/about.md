  I'm a masters student in Computational Finance and Risk Management at the the University of Washignton in Seattle. I am highly interested in Systematic Investing(trend following, global macro, momentum) and Data Science particularly in machine learning, explorative analysis and data visualization. This Portfolio provides some projects that interest me.
